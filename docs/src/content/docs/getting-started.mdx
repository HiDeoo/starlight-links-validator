A [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) plugin to validate **_internal_** links in Markdown and MDX files.

- Validate internal links to other pages
- Validate internal links to hashes in other pages
- Validate internal links to hashes in the same page
- Ignore external links
- Run only during a production build

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import { PackageManagers } from '@hideoo/starlight-plugins-docs-components'

<Steps>

1. Starlight Links Validator is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/). Install it using your favorite package manager:

   <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-links-validator" />

2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

   ```diff lang="js"
   // astro.config.mjs
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   +import starlightLinksValidator from 'starlight-links-validator'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starlight({
   +      plugins: [starlightLinksValidator()],
         title: 'My Docs',
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

3. Run a [production build](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-build) to validate all internal links in your Markdown and MDX files.

</Steps>

The Starlight Links Validator plugin behavior can be tweaked using various [configuration options](/configuration).
